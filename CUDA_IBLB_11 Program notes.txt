The program takes 10 arguments: 
[c_fraction] [c_num] [c_space] [Re] [T_num] [T_pow] [I_num] [P_num] [ShARC] [BigData]

Recommended arguments for test simulations:
1 6 48 1.0 1 6 1 100 0 1

This program has been written in a combination of CUDA and C++ using the following software versions:
- Microsift Visual Studio Community 2015 14.0
- NVIDIA CUDA 8.0
- NVIDIA Nsight Visual Studio Edition 5.2

The program has been optimised to run on an NVIDIA TESLA K80 graphics card, and will not run on a computer with no graphics card available.

Data is written to '.dat' files that are formated for plotting with gnuplot. Data is written to a directory within CUDA_IBLB_11 by default. This can be changed in 'main.cu'. Subdirectories should be created based on simulation parameters [c_num] and [c_fraction]:
Data\
|Test\
||Raw\
|||[c_num]\
||||[c_fraction]\
||Cilia\
|||[c_num]\
||||[c_fraction]\
||Flux\
